#Chess Analysis GUI

This is a work in progress chess game analysis GUI built on nodewebkit.

Features Planned:
- Load PGN and step through the moves
- Make new moves, and have a nested PGN with the alternative lines
- Communicate with the Stockfish Engine for computational scores
- Allow the drawing of arrows and highlighting of squares for analysis
- Allow for new annotations to be made, and the resulting PGN to be saved to disk
- Pretty graphs ala [lichess.org](http://en.lichess.org/JWwTnTcNorg/) for analysis at a glance
